Playwright locator methods :
----------------------------

nth(), first(), and last() are Playwright Locator API methods.

They help you choose which element to act on when a locator matches multiple elements.

What is a callback function?

A callback is just a function you give to another function, and you are telling it:

👉 “When you finish your work, call this function back.”

That’s it!

Simple Example (Real Life)

Ordering Pizza

You call a pizza shop and tell them:

“Here is my number.
When the pizza is ready, call me back.”

You don’t wait on the phone.
You go do your own work.

Later, the pizza shop finishes making your pizza → they call you back.

That phone call = callback.

💻 Same Logic in JavaScript

function makePizza(callback) {

    console.log("Making pizza...");

    setTimeout(() => {
        console.log("Pizza ready!");
        callback(); // calling back
    }, 2000);

}

makePizza(() => {
    console.log("Eat the pizza!");
});

What’s happening?

You give a function → () => { console.log("Eat the pizza!"); }

makePizza() does its work.

When it's finished, it calls your function back.

*** Why do we use callbacks?

Because some tasks take time:

✔ Reading files
✔ Calling APIs
✔ Waiting for user input
✔ Waiting for timers

Instead of blocking everything, JS says:

“Give me a function, I’ll call you back when I’m done.”

***Simple one-line definition

A callback is a function passed to another function so it can run later.

How Youtube Search Works (Using Callbacks):

## YOUTUBE CALLBACK EXAMPLE – COMPLETE CODE

javascript
function playVideo(user, video, onSaveHistory, onShowRecommendations) {
    console.log(user + " is watching: " + video);

    // Calling callback functions
    onSaveHistory(user, video);
    onShowRecommendations(video);
}

// Callback 1
function saveHistory(user, video) {
    console.log("Video saved to history for user:", user);
}

// Callback 2
function showRecommendations(video) {
    console.log("Showing recommended videos related to:", video);
}

// Function Call
playVideo("Arun", "JavaScript Basics", saveHistory, showRecommendations);


---

## EXPECTED OUTPUT

Arun is watching: JavaScript Basics
Video saved to history for user: Arun
Showing recommended videos related to: JavaScript Basics

---

## Explanation :

playVideo() is the main YouTube action.
saveHistory() and showRecommendations() are callback functions passed as arguments and executed inside playVideo().

---

If you want real-world style (with server delay simulation), here is async version.

---

## YOUTUBE REALISTIC (ASYNC) VERSION

javascript
function playVideo(user, video, callback) {
    console.log(user + " clicked play on: " + video);

    // Simulating server delay (like fetching video stream)
    setTimeout(function () {
        console.log("Server: Video stream loaded successfully");
        callback();
    }, 2000);
}

function afterVideoStarts() {
    console.log("Updating UI, tracking analytics, and loading recommendations...");
}

playVideo("Arun", "JavaScript Basics", afterVideoStarts);


---

## OUTPUT (after 2 seconds)

Arun clicked play on: JavaScript Basics
Server: Video stream loaded successfully
Updating UI, tracking analytics, and loading recommendations...

---

Summary:

playVideo() = Main YouTube action
Other features (history, recommendations, analytics) = Callback functions
Callback means: After this event completes, execute this function.
