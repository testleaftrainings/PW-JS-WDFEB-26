📑 Agenda for Week1 Day04 : Operators, Control Statements and Strings in JS

📆 Date: 19 February [Thursday]
 
🕝 Session Highlights

 Recap 
- Key takeaways from the previous session:  
Introduction to JavaScript, Mastering Variables and its behaviours.

1. Opertors and Control Statements :
- Various JavaScript Operators 
- Control Statments like if-else, switch, for loop, while loop

2. String :
- Exploring Methods and Real-world Use Cases
- [Practice] Solve String-based Problems


🕡 Wrap Up / Q&A 

📝 Keep your physical notebook and pen handy to sketch out ideas!


Notes :
------


looping :
--------

while → “Check first, then act”
do-while → “Act first, then check”

Login Retry Example (Framework Level) - do while loop :
-----------------------------------------
let loginSuccess;
let attempt = 0;

do {
    loginSuccess = await performLogin(username, password);
    attempt++;

} while (!loginSuccess && attempt < 3);

if (!loginSuccess) {
    console.log("Account locked or invalid credentials");
}


null == undefined → Why TRUE?
console.log(null == undefined);  // true

-------------------------------------------------------------

Strict Equality (===) in undefined and null:
-----------------------------------------------

1️⃣ console.log(null === undefined) // false
🔎 Internally (Abstract Equality Comparison Algorithm)

When JS sees:

null == undefined


It follows a special rule defined in ECMAScript spec:

If one value is null and the other is undefined, return true.

🚨 No type conversion happens here.

It is a direct hard-coded rule in the spec.

So internally:

Step 1: Types are different
Step 2: Check special rule
If x is null AND y is undefined → return true

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1️⃣ console.log(undefined === undefined) // true

Why is this true?

Both sides are undefined

Same type → undefined

Same value → undefined

So result is true.

2️⃣ Loose Equality (==)
== checks:

✅ Value

⚠️ Allows type conversion (coercion)

console.log(undefined == undefined) // true
Why is this also true?

Because:

Both sides are already undefined

No type conversion needed

They are identical

So result is again true.
