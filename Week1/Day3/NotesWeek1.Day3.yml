🎯 Focus: Behaviour of variable declaration in JS, Functions

Classroom Activity - Using scopes and hoisting in JavaScript to understand variable declarations and function behavior.



Variable Declarations in JavaScript:

- JavaScript has three ways to declare variables: `var`, `let`, and `const

- `var` is function-scoped and can be re-declared and updated. It is hoisted to the top of its scope, but only the declaration is hoisted, not the initialization.
- `let` is block-scoped and can be updated but not re-declared within the same scope. It is also hoisted, but it is not initialized until its definition is evaluated, which means it cannot be accessed before declaration (Temporal Dead Zone).
- `const` is block-scoped and cannot be updated or re-declared. Like `let`, it is hoisted but not initialized until its definition is evaluated.

------------------------------------------

functions in JavaScript:
- Functions in JavaScript can be declared in several ways: function declarations, function expressions, and arrow functions.
- Function declarations are hoisted, meaning you can call the function before its declaration in the code

Example of Function Declaration Hoisting:

greet(); // Output: "Hello, World!"
function greet() {
  console.log("Hello, World!");
}

------------------------------------------

Hoisting in JavaScript:
- Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase.
- This means that you can use variables and functions before they are declared in the code.
Example of Hoisting with Variables:

console.log(x); // Output: undefined
var x = 5;

------------------------------------------

Scoping in JavaScript:
- JavaScript has function scope and block scope. Variables declared with `var` are function-scoped, while variables declared with `let` and `const` are block-scoped.
- This means that variables declared with `var` are accessible throughout the entire function, while variables declared with `let` and `const` are only accessible within the block they are defined in.

Example of Scoping:

function example() {
  if (true) {
    var functionScoped = "I am function scoped";
    let blockScoped = "I am block scoped";
  }
  console.log(functionScoped); // Output: "I am function scoped"
  console.log(blockScoped); // ReferenceError: blockScoped is not defined
}

Naming conventions in JavaScript followed but not strictly adhered :
------------------------------------------------------------------


Variables -->	camelCase	
let userName

Functions --> camelCase	
function getData()

Object Properties-->	camelCase	
user.firstName

Classes / Constructors -->	PascalCase	
class UserProfile
