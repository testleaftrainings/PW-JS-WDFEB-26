Notes :
------

CSS Selectors :
-------------

text based CSS selectors :
------------------------

a:has-text('Leads') --> This selector will match any <a> element that contains the text "Leads" anywhere within it. 
It is useful for selecting elements based on their visible text content, regardless of their position in the DOM.

innerText() --> This is a property that returns the visible text content of an element, including its descendants.
It is often used in Playwright to retrieve the text content of an element for assertions or to

textContent() --> This is a method that returns the text content of an element, including its descendants.
It is often used in Playwright to retrieve the text content of an element for assertions or to perform operations based on the text content.

Partial attribute values :
--------------------------

input[name*="USER"] --> contains

[id^="name"] --> starts with

[id$="name"] --> end with 

---------------------------------------------------------
Absolute Xpath :
/html/body/div[2]/div[2]/div/form/p/input


Relative Xpath :

Two types :
---------

Basic Relative Xpath :

//tagName[@attribute='attributeValue’] --> attribute based xpath
//tagName[text()='text value in DOM']  --> text based xpath
//tagName[contains(@attribute, 'Partial value of the attribute')] --> partial attribute based xpath
//tagname[contains(text(),' Partial text in my DOM' ')] --> partial text based xpath
(//tagName[@attribute='attributeValue'])[index] --> collection based xpath
